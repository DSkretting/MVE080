    "This is the first worksheet in the course *Scientific Visualization*. This Jupyter notebook has three functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It describes the tasks.\n",
    "2. It (sometimes) provides coding templates that you can use as a basis for your own code.\n",
    "3. It is a template also for the report that you upload in Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks are of various types: some are to read some text and then comment on it (no coding), and some are about creating visualizations using plotnine.\n",
    "Once you're finished with all the tasks, export this document as an HTML-file and upload it in Canvas.\n",
    "You are encouraged to discuss problems and solutions with your fellow students (in the class-room but also on CampusWire), but each student must solve all tasks by themselves and hand-in their own report.\n",
    "Notice that Jupyter notebooks use [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links) for writing text cells. Make sure you understand the basics. Later on you can also include $\\LaTeX$ in your Markdown cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the assignment you shall use a Python workflow.\n",
    "If you are completely new to Python, take a look at [this page](pythonbasics.org).\n",
    "Python can do essentially all that MATLAB can, plus more. \n",

    "## Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Read Chapter 1-3 of [Fundamentals of Data Visualizations](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/), then answer the questions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1.1\n",
    "Describe the visualization concept _scales_. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer 1.1\n",
    "The concept of scales in data visualization refers to the foundational principle of mapping data values to aesthetic elements, such as size,color and position.\n",
    "Each scale has a one-to-one correspondence, ensuring that every single data value is paired with a unique aesthetic attribute, and each aestetic attribute corresponds to one, and ony one, data value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1.2\n",
    "In Figures 2.3 and 2.4 the same data is visualized in two different ways. Discuss the pros and cons of the two approaches. Which one do you prefer and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer 1.2\n",
    "Figure 2.3: Line Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "-Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Clear trends: A line graph displays clear temperature trends over time, makeing it easy to see the rise and fall of temperature throughtout the year for the different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Easy comparrisons: A line graph allows for easy compastsion between locations at any specific point in time, as we can quickly compare the heights of the lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "-cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Overlapping: Lines can overlap, which can make it difficult to destinguish between data points\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2.4: Heat Map\n",
    "\n",
    "-Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Visual clarity: The heatmap uses color intensities to represent temperature, which makes it easy to immediatly identify areas of high and low temperatures.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "-cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Hard to compare: It is hard to compare precise temperatures between locations, as we must look at the color shade and then refer back to the color scale to get an aproximation of the exact temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1.3\n",
    "Describe situations when _nonlinear axes_ might be useful.\n",
    "When should they not be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer 1.3\n",
